# Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection is the process of identifying for example data points in a dataset that differ from the norm.
There are two assumptions in anomaly detection:
1. Anomalies occur very rarely in the data.
2. The features of anomalies differ from the normal instances significantly.

## Univariate Anomaly Detection


### Algorithms
<b>Isolation Forest</b><br>
One algorithm for anomaly detection in univariate data is Isolation Forest. The Isolation Forest model is a tree-based model 

```console
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
```
